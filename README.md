# MAGPIE - Monitoring AGainst cyber PhysIcal thrEats

This is the repository for the MAGPIE prototype draft code and attack datasets developed. There exists a number of outstanding development and minor bug issues requiring updates, but these should be easily rectified if required by researchers and developers. Some of these issues are highlighted below, but more may be added in the near future. However, the attack datasets are complete and can be utilised without issue.
